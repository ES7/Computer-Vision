# Aruco-Placement-Section
**ID detector.py :-** It will detect the IDs of all four aruco markers.

**Atulya :-** Here first I have imported all the necessary libraries and images, then I have made a list of aruco markers and its ids, I have made a function `"findArucoMarkers"` which will return IDs and then I have appended IDs list w.r.t the return value of above function. Then I have made a function arucocoordinates which will find the coordinates of aruco markers, cropimg function will crop the markers and remove its white padding, fixaruco function will find the angle of marker and will rotate
it such that angle becomes zero so it will be easy to crop.findColor function will check  the color of squares and return its corresponding ID value.
In for loop I have first find the contours and stored it in approx, then I have detected squares using `boundingRect` function, the if statment wil check the
angle of each square and its height and width. The next if statments will check the color of each square by calling findColor function, then it will fill the
square with black color, it will resize the corresponding aruco marker and rotate with the same angle as of square and then it will replace the square with marker.
For loop will iterate four times as we have four squares and the final image is saved as **final.jpg**.

Marker ID 1 on Green Square </br>
Marker ID 2 on Orange Square </br>
Marker ID 3 on Black Square </br> 
Marker ID 4 on Pink Square

The model is trained in the `Training.ipynb` file and you can test it from `Testing.ipynb`. The `harcascade_frontalface_default. ` is a pre-trained machine learning model for face detection, which is commonly used in computer vision applications. The term "Haarcascade" refers to the **Haar-like** features used by the classifier, and "Frontal Face" indicates that the classifier is specifically trained to detect **frontal views** of human faces.

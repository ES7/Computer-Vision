# Emotion Detection Using CNN
The dataset I have downloaded from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013 </br>
The model is trained in the `Training.ipynb` file and `Testing.ipynb` file is use fro testing. The `harcascade_frontalface_default. ` is a pre-trained machine learning model for face detection, which is commonly used in computer vision applications. The term "Haarcascade" refers to the **Haar-like** features used by the classifier, and "Frontal Face" indicates that the classifier is specifically trained to detect **frontal views** of human faces.

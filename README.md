# OpenCV
In this repository I have uploaded my opencv codes which I have learned when I was a beginner. In the `Aruco Marker Placement` folder I have performed a small task based on aruco markers. In the `Face, Hand, Pose Detection` folder I have tried to explain the use of **mediapipe** library of python and how to use it for face, hand and pose detection.

I have written a python script using mediapipe library by which we can draw on the screen by our hand movements. The htm.py file detects the hand and the finger tips
If the index finger is up the we are in the drawing mode and if index and middle finger is up we are in the selection mode where we can select different pen colors
and eraser.

# YOLO (You Only Look Once)
**YOLO :-** https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/yolo-explained-5b6f4564f31  </br>
It is an **object detection** algorithm used in computer vision and deep learning.
YOLO's main goal is to detect and localize objects within an image or video frame in real-time.
Unlike some other object detection methods that involve multiple stages or sliding window approaches,
YOLO processes the entire image in **one go** and predicts **bounding boxes** and **class probabilities** for the objects present. </br>
The YOLO algorithm divides the input image into a **grid**, and each grid cell is responsible for predicting objects that are located within it.
For each grid cell, YOLO predicts multiple bounding boxes along with the corresponding class probabilities. The key innovation of YOLO is that
it combines object detection and localization into a **single regression problem**, allowing it to be extremely fast and efficient. </br>
YOLO has gone through several iterations, with **YOLOv1** being the initial version and subsequent versions like **YOLOv2**, **YOLOv3**, and **YOLOv4** introducing
improvements in terms of accuracy and speed. Each version has built upon the previous one by refining the network architecture, introducing various enhancements,
and addressing limitations. </br>
YOLO's real-time capabilities make it suitable for applications such as **object tracking**, **self-driving cars**, **surveillance**, and more. It has been widely adopted
in the computer vision community and has contributed to the advancement of object detection techniques.
